Scenario:
I am a game developer, recently I have developed a game in metaverse, for promoting
my game, I am providing my special ERC-20 tokens called EGame, for the first time
game play. Also, to be more transparent I want users to verify the scores and the
amount of EGame provided to the user through a blockchain environment. All the
scores of users are logged on the blockchain even after the first gameplay.
your role is to provide a system where:
1. User can claim n numbers of EGame tokens in WEI if scores n in the first game play
only
2. Each score of users is logged on the chain, even after the first play.
3. Should be a scaled-up system
4. User can connect with a simple button using a metamask extension
